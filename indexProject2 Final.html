										<p>Quentin Tarantino’s 1994 film Pulp Fiction, tells the stories of multiple characters in anon-linear timeline, who cross paths with each other throughout the film. Among those characters is a man named Butch, played by Bruce Willis. He is a boxer who got payed by the gangster Marsellus Wallace to lose his upcoming boxing match. However he decides not to go through with it. The sequence to be analyzed is the day after the fight. Butch is hiding out in a motel with his girlfriend Fabienne, knowing that Marsellus’ people will be looking for him. They’re talking about the breakfast they want to have just before hitting the road, as Butch looks for a watch in his suitcase. He searches frantically, throwing stuff around the room, yelling at Fabienne asking her if she was sure to have packed the watch; she says she did, but the watch is nowhere to be found. This sequence is about the significance an object can have on a person. Most importantly, it shows how masculinity affects Butch.</p>

										<p>	In Spike Lee’s controversial and striking film of 1989 Do the Right Thing, Lee shows a day in the life of Mookie and his community in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. The film can be fun at times, but in the end, it sends a powerful message about racism and police brutality in America. One of the many ways that Lee communicates this is through cinematography. Take when Radio Raheem, Buggin’ Out, and Smiley walk into Sal’s pizzeria (1:29:44-1:31:48). Sal has a wall where he has pictures of Italian-American celebrities, but given that the majority of his clientele is black, they are there to demand Sal to put up pictures of African-American people as well. Buggin’ Out had suggested this once before but was turned away. Right as they walk into the pizzeria, the shot is at a canted angle. </p>

										<p>Science fiction can be an extremely underrated genre. People tend to disregard it as not serious enough, not universal enough, or just mediocre entertainment. People look down on stories about made-up planets and alien species, deeming that they’re not relatable. However, it seems to me that these alien stories can sometimes portray humanity even better than other non- science fiction stories. After all, that is what science fiction movies do; “[they] reflect world- wide anxieties, and [...] allay them” (Sontag, 42). This is one of the arguments that Susan Sontag makes in her 1965 essay The Imagination of Disaster. Sontag believes that fantasy stories have two possible effects on their audience: They can serve as an escape and/or distraction from our regular lives, or they can actually “normalize what is psychologically unbearable” (Sontag, 42). In her essay, Sontag also breaks down three sorts of formulas that science fiction movies tend to follow. Even if these typical examples were based on movies before 1965, they are still completely applicable to the science fiction movies we see today.</p>

										<p>François Truffaut’s 1959 film The 400 Blows, tells the story of Antoine Doinel, a teenager living in Paris. In this scene, Antoine is running late for school, but as soon as he steps out the door, his friend René calls out to him. Since he is late as well, they share the concern that their teacher won’t even let them in. René then asks Antoine if he has money on him, and convinces him to skip school all together and go explore the city instead.</p>

										<p>Before the fight, Butch has a dream or flashback of when he was a little boy. A soldier friend of his handed him a gold watch and explains how it had belonged to his great-grandfather during World War I, his grandfather during World War II, and his father during the Vietnam War. The soldier was passing it now onto Butch since his father died. The watch symbolizes strength and honor to Butch; he aspires to be a man as his ancestors were. Butch was coming from a line of brave men who served and fought for their country, and he was the first to break that line. Hewas a fighter yes, but for money and not his country. That is why after this flashback, he decides to fight to win and run the risk of being killed by Marsellus Wallace for not following his terms.</p>

										<p>Radio Raheem and Buggin’ Out come in blasting loud music and screaming at Sal, and this is all communicated by the choice of framing. The fact that it is shot from a canted angle and in close-ups signifies the anger and disfunction present in the characters and it unsettles the viewer during this aggressive exchange. Another interesting thing to point out is the tilt on that canted angle as well. It appears that Radio Raheem and Buggin’ Out are shot from a slightly lower angle than Sal; this is to show that, at least initially, Sal is the one with less power since he is being looked down on.</p>

										<p>The message this film leaves the audience with is that knowing the future doesn't really affect things, and that the experience is what truly has meaning in our lives. It’s a powerful and tragically beautiful ending, because it’s about something that is psychologically unbearable yet amazing in a way. It shows the story of a woman that will lose her daughter no matter what she does, but she would much rather feel the love a mother has for her child, than to not experience that at all. Arrival is not a disaster movie, or another alien invasion movie, it is a movie about what it means to be human.</p>

										<p>The scene is composed mainly of long shots of Antoine and René walking around the city and a medium shot when the boys first meet outside Antoine’s house. The camera has an objective point of view since it is following their movement. The role the camera plays in this sequence is very interesting. The first 29 seconds, the camera moves to Antoine’s pace. For example, when he comes out of the house, the camera pans at the same speed that Antoine is running. Once René calls out to him, the camera stops and actually pans back a little, as Antoine stops to look back at his friend. It then moves slowly as Antoine walks next to René, before coming to a stop as the boys walk off and then it cuts to another scene.</p>
